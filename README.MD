# Quiz Game inspired by The Complete Javascript Course - Jonas Schmedtmann

* This is a quiz game (Javascript questions) that is currently solely in the console. Completely self-coded and conforms to the following requirements from the course:

---

1. Build a function constructor called Question - it should include:
    * Question itself
    * Answers from which the player can choose the correct one
    * Correct answer 

2. Create some questions using the constructor and store them inside an array

4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers 

5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask user for the correct answer. User should input the number of the correct answer

6. Check if answer is correct and print to the console whether or not it is. 

7. After displaying the result, display another random question, so the game continues.

8. Include the option to quit the game if the user writes 'exit' instead of the answer.

9. Track the user's score. Each time an answer is correct, add 1 point to the score.
    * My game subtracts one point if answer is incorrect. 

10. Display the score in the console.
